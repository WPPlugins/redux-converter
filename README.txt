Redux Converter allows you to get going with Redux Framework almost instantly. Just install and run in a theme using one of the supported frameworks, and try out the same panel and data in Redux. Also download a config file & data conversion!

== Description ==

Redux Converter takes the pain out of trying Redux with your current framework. It auto-generates a fully functional panel with compatable fields. It even has auto-generated code for you to migrate your data from/to.

After you intall the plugin, it will search for supported framework(s) that may be installed. You will then see a new Admin Menu option names `XXX 2 Redux`. Click that item for a fully functional panel using Redux Framework, your current panel configuration and your current data.

= Supported Frameworks = 
* SMOF - Slightly Modified Options Framework
* OptionTree

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this really work? =
Yes.

= Are you sure? =
Yes.

= Really? =
Yes. Try it already!

= Will my data get messed up if I try it? =
Nope. Everything in the demo panel is stored in a transient table that expires after an hour. To fully convert to Redux, we have a section that generates an actual config file for you.

= Sounds great, but my users will be up a creek! =
Not true. With the config file there's also a data conversion function that's provided so your users can switch. It only runs on theme activation (upgrade) too!

= Wow, this is amazing! How can I help? =
Please donate!

== Screenshots ==

1. This demonstrates how you can take any theme using one of the accepted frameworks, and run it through Redux. Avada is a trademark of ThemeFusion. We only used this theme as it has a fair amount of exposure. We claim no rights to Avada.  :P
